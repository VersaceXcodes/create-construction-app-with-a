A frontend bug in the dashboard's product display component causes infinite re-rendering/re-fetching of these images, likely in a React useEffect or image loading loop without proper dependencies.

When the user mentions generic pages, map them to concrete files/components by scanning for headings and routes. Examples you MUST follow:
- If the user says "login" or "sign in", search for components containing the literal heading "Sign in to your account" and edit that file.
- If the user says "sign up" or "register", search for "Create your account" or equivalent.
- Always return an explicit list of changed file paths. If your first attempt doesn't change the UI, re-search by heading text and update the correct file.

⚠️ PRIORITY INSTRUCTIONS:
- The user's request above is the PRIMARY task. Complete it first.
- Ignore any existing errors, warnings, or issues you detect in the project unless they directly prevent you from completing the user's requested task.
- Do NOT automatically fix unrelated errors or refactor code unless explicitly requested.
- Focus solely on implementing the user's request: "Fix: Infinite Image Loop: Triggered by /dashboard URL Exact Trace 19:07:42 - User clicked "Sign In": 🖱️ Clicked button with index 16: Sign In 19:07:43 - Login successful, page navigates: POST /api/auth/login HTTP/1.1 200 ➡️ Page navigation [0]123create-construction-app-with-a... took 0.51s 19:07:44 - Dashboard page loaded, API calls made: GET /api/projects HTTP/1.1 200 (referer: .../dashboard) GET /api/cart HTTP/1.1 200 (referer: .../dashboard) GET /api/products?limit=12&sort_by=sales_count... 200 (referer: .../dashboard) GET /api/wishlist HTTP/1.1 200 (referer: .../dashboard) 19:07:44.355 - 19:07:44.920 - Infinite loop starts, hundreds of requests: 📡 REQUEST: GET .../placeholder-product.png 📡 RESPONSE: 200 .../placeholder-product.png 📡 REQUEST: GET .../placeholder-product.png 📡 RESPONSE: 200 .../placeholder-product.png [... repeats hundreds of times ...] Root Cause URL: https://123create-construction-app-with-a.launchpulse.ai/dashboard The dashboard loads products (via /api/products?limit=12), then renders them with placeholder-product.png images.

- Only address errors if they block the specific functionality requested by the user.
